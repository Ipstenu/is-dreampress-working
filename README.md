Is DreamPress Working

This code is based on http://www.isvarnishworking.com/ - without ever seeing the backend code, I've set about trying to replicate it.

Currently it works, but it has some room to grow

Demo: http://breakwpdh.com/testdreampress.php

		To Do
		
		1) This site doesn't look like WP
		2) Look for known COOKIE PROBLEMS
		3) Failures
		4) Not Varnish (i.e. not DreamPress) - Show nameservers
		5) If cloudflare...
		6) PHPSessions - explain
		7) Max-Age 0
		8) If HTTPS...
